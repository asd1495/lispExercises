# Lisp Exercises

This repository contains my exercises and practice scripts for learning **Common Lisp**.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

The exercises in this repository help reinforce concepts such as:

-   Basic arithmetic operations
-   Variable definitions 
-   Conditionals
-   Logical operators
-   Function definitions and recursion

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Running the Code

To run these Lisp scripts, you need a **Common Lisp environment**. I am using **CLISP** ([CLISP on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/clisp/)) to run the code and **Notepad** to write and save files.

As an alternative you can install **SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)** on Ubuntu with:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sbcl
```

### Running a Lisp Script

Once SBCL is installed, navigate to the repository folder and execute:

```sh
sbcl --script basics.lisp
```

Alternatively, you can open an interactive REPL by running:

```sh
sbcl
```

Then, load a file within the REPL using:

```lisp
(load "basics.lisp")
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

-   This repository is a **work in progress**, and I will continue adding more advanced exercises.
-   Feel free to clone and try out the exercises for your own learning!
